# FinalProject
This is the beggining layout of a choose your own adventure game that icludes some simple stats. The number of these stats will influence the choices the player will be able to make throughout the adventure, and it will influence the ending, which is going to be printed out in its own text file.
Turning this in unfinished because first semester is over. If its any consolation I'm defintly going to finish this in my spare time 
I really like the psuedo-lovecraftain theme I have going on when a player makes the wrong decision, or tries to quit/leave early. 
Additionally I'd like to say, thank you for your patience Dr.Zeitz, this first semester has taught me my limits, it's really been the first time I've ever done
worse than i'd liked in school, but moving forward to next semester I've gained an understanding of how much work I need to put in
and what kind of habits i need to form.
